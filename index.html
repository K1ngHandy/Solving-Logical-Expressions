    PROBLEM 1: Log to the console a condition that uses an “AND” operator to check if 3 is greater than 1 and five is less than 8.
    */
    console.log(3 > 1 && 5 < 8)

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Declare a variable named “myNumber” and assign it a value of 45.  Log to the console a condition that uses an “OR” operator to check if “myNumber” is less than 5 or greater than 21.

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Declare a variable named “num” and assign it to a value of 7.  Log to the console a condition that uses an “AND” operator to check if “num” is equal to 7 and equal to “7”(with quotes).  Also log a condition that uses an “OR” operator to check the same two comparative expressions.  Did the two print the same or different boolean values?
   */
    let num = 7
    console.log(num === 7 && num === '7')
    console.log(num === 7 || num === '7') // Different outcome

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Log to the console a condition that uses an "OR" operator to check if 3 / 0 is equal to undefined OR if 3 / 0 is equal to NaN.
    */
    console.log(3 / 0 === undefined || 3 / 0 === NaN)

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following condition prints “false” to the console. Fix one of the operators so that the condition prints “true”.
    */

    let myString = "I have a string."
    console.log(myString === "I have a string." && myString === "I have a string.")
